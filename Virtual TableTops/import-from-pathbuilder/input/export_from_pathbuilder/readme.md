### New to-do:  write a script to add the missing items from the stat block export to the json export

- [ ] custom language names
- [ ] text for class abilities
- [ ] links for spells
- [ ] links for formulae / recipes 
- [ ] links for feats
- [ ] links for special abilities

---
I noticed that some exports have details that others don't have, so some goals will require both the json and the stat block.  (No information is only found in the character sheet)
